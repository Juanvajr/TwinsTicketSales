# TwinsTicketSales
Project from the Minnesota Twins.

2021 Strategy & Business Operations Candidate Project
For this exercise, you are being tasked with creating campaign lists based on the (fictitious) customer data sets provided and the rules below.

Universal rules:
•	Nobody should receive multiple copies of the same email, even if they have different account IDs with the same email address. Fans can be a part of multiple campaigns.
•	Files are not mutually exclusive, Season Ticket Holders may also be Single Game Buyers
•	If a fan has been contacted by a Twins Sales Rep after 3/28/2021 (based on the CRM ownership file), any sales email should come from that reps email address
•	Any service email, and any sales email to a fan who has not been contacted since 3/28/2021, should come from tickets@twinsbaseball.com
•	No current Twins Season Ticket Holder should receive any message about purchasing additional tickets
Each campaign may also have audience criteria that need to be applied in addition to the universal rules above
